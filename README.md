# Web-Design-Challenge

This repository contains the html and associated assets for a Weather Data Visualisation website.  

The url for the website is: https://mford80.github.io/Web-Design-Challenge/index.html  

The repository contains the following:  
* the index.html in the parent folder
* the html files for six additional pages in the visualisations folder
* data visualisation images generated from the initial analysis and used in the webpages in the assets/images folder
* the css style file in the assets/css folder 
  
In addition this repository contains the original csv file of the data that was analysed in the Resources folder.  
There is an additional python notebook (to_html.pynb) in the parent folder which demonstrates the process used to convert this csv into a html format. This notebook has no bearing on the website, and is included here for interest purposes only.
